# Understanding the Repository

## Start with the README 
- Many repos have a README file that explains the structure, purpose, and setup instructions. This is the first map.

## Folder Structure
- If no `README.md` available, then start by exploring key directories such as `tests/` or `e2e/`.

## Entry Points
- Look for `Program.cs`, `Startup.cs`, or configuration files to understand project setup.

## Break It Down
- Focus on one section at a time. Try to understand a specific function or workflow before moving to the next.

## Run the Code
- If possible, set up the project and run a sample test. Observing it in action can make things click.

## Debugging Tips
- Trace imports to follow dependencies, then step through execution using breakpoints or logging to observe how the code flows.

## Playwright Configuration
- Check `playwright.config.ts` or JSON files to find browser settings.
