# Writing Automated E2E and Integration Tests with Test Isolation

Balancing end-to-end (E2E) or integration test coverage with strong test isolation is essential for creating reliable and maintainable test suites. Here are some best practices to follow:

## ✅ 1. Test Data Isolation
- Create test-specific data at the start of each test using APIs, DB scripts, or the UI if needed.
- Tear down or reset data after each test to prevent state leakage.
- Use unique identifiers (e.g., UUIDs, timestamps) to avoid data collisions during parallel test execution.

## ✅ 2. Environment Control
- Run tests in dedicated environments using Docker, Kubernetes, or isolated cloud environments.
- Mock or stub unstable third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, email providers) when appropriate.

## ✅ 3. Keep Tests Focused
- Each E2E or integration test should validate one specific flow or behavior.
- Avoid mixing multiple test goals in a single scenario to make failure debugging easier.

## ✅ 4. Safe Parallel Execution
- Scope database records, file paths, or queues by test session.
- Leverage temp workspaces or configuration overrides to isolate test artifacts.

## ✅ 5. Use Setup/Teardown Hooks
- Apply test hooks like `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` to maintain clean test states.
- Automate user creation, feature toggle setup, and data cleanup where possible.
