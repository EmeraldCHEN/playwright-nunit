# Understanding the Repository

## Folder Structure
- No README available, so start by exploring key directories such as `tests/` or `e2e/`.

## Entry Points
- Look for `Program.cs`, `Startup.cs`, or configuration files to understand project setup.

## Debugging Tips
- Trace imports, set breakpoints, and run the code to see execution flow.

## Playwright Configuration
- Check `playwright.config.ts` or JSON files to find browser settings.
